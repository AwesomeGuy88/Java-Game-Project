Master_tanks by Ethan Yee and David Hamill

GAME:
Our game uses the library javafx, so to compile it on ubuntu using the computers in the UG labs, you will need to run the master_tanks.sh bash script.
Make sure all of the .java and .png files are in a folder called src. The src folder, the manifest file, and the bash script should be in the same directory.
The bash script and the manifest file are in compile_files_for_ubuntu.zip. Make sure that before running the bas script, you right click it, select properties, and check 'allow executable file as programme' under the permissions tab.

To compile and run the code, open the terminal and change the directory to the one containing master_tanks.sh, then type:
	./master_tanks.sh
Easy peasy!



MULTIPLAYER:
1. You need to open up the python file containing the code for the server and input
the local IP address and desired port number of the local machine

2. The game can only be run on windows.

3. You need to unzip the public folder
